== PROJECT: 3VIA

---

== Overview

The purpose of the portfolio is to document my role and contributions to project 3VIA.
3VIA is a desktop flash card application designed for self-driven learners to reinforce their knowledge.
The main form of interaction with the application is via the keyboard.
3 notable features are learning, testing and reviewing. This is a team-based project.
My main role was to review the code quality written by each member which is done by reviewing each memberâ€™s pull request on Github.
Additionally, my main task was to implement a mass import feature.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the ability to *import multiple cards*.
** What it does: allows the user to add multiple cards into 3VIA at one go.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly for 2 main reasons. Firstly, it incentivises non-existing users to use 3VIA more as the users can import their existing digital notes quickly. Secondly, the time saved from adding new cards into 3VIA can be used for more revision.
** Highlights: This enhancement allows grouping of multiple pairs of questions and answers under a set of topics. Thereby reducing the need to repeatedly tag each question and answer pair with the same set of topics.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com[Functional code]] [https://github.com[Test code]]
