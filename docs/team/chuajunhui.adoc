== Overview

3VIA is a desktop application that can be used by motivated learners who wants to reinforce their knowledge. 3VIA features 3 main
components to facilitate this reinforcement of knowledge, namely learning, testing and reviewing. 3VIA was written
using Java, with the user mainly interacting with 3VIA through command line but an user interface is also provided that
was created using JavaFX.

== Summary of contributions

//* *Major enhancement*: added the ability to *import multiple cards*.
//** What it does: allows the user to add multiple cards into 3VIA at one go.
//** Justification: This feature incentivises non-existing users to use 3VIA more as the users can import their existing digital notes quickly.
//** Highlights: This enhancement allows grouping of multiple pairs of questions and answers under a set of topics. Thereby reducing the need to repeatedly tag each question and answer pair with the same set of topics.
