* This is a desktop Trivia application. It has a GUI, but it is largely functional using the CLI (Command Line Interface).
* Purpose: For students to create their deck of flashcards and to test their knowledge, in preparation for finals.

* What's different from https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4[AddressBookLevel 4]:
** Tags used to sort out input questions into decks 
** Aspire to create this into a game ((version 2))
** Support for _Build Automation_ using Gradle and for _Continuous Integration_ using Travis CI.
